    <h2>1. First Impressions at Joshua Tree National Park</h2>

    <div>
      Our first stop is Joshua Tree National Park, stretching across the border
      of California and Nevada,<br />
      renowned for its picturesque sunsets and mesmerizing stars.<br />
      Here, you can experience the unique Joshua Trees against the backdrop of
      the vast universe. <br />At night, the silent embrace of nature, combined
      with the unfolding stage of the stars, feels like a celestial guide
      leading us into the cosmos.

      stretching endlessly. <br />Enjoy a road trip filled with the unique
      Joshua Trees, various shrubs, and magnificent rock formations created by
      nature.

    <h3>Adorable Cacti Warnings!</h3>

    <div>
      During the day, while waiting for the stars, take the time to capture
      photos of the diverse and cute cacti unique to Joshua Tree National Park.
      <br />However, be cautious as some of these seemingly adorable cacti carry
      lethal toxins.<br />Watch your steps and handle them with care when
      capturing their beauty through your camera lens.
    </div>

    <h3>Nature's Art: Skull Rock</h3>

    <div>
      Among the many rocks in Joshua Tree National Park, none are as distinctive
      as Skull Rock. <br />The combination of its massive size and the
      skull-like shape crafted by nature captures the imagination.
    </div>

    <h3>Camping under the Stars</h3>

    <div>
      Joshua Tree National Park is renowned for its camping sites.<br />
      Camping under the night sky, amidst the chilly desert air, accompanied by
      warm food, creates unforgettable memories.
    </div><hr>

    <h2>2. Communicating with the Stars at Griffith Observatory</h2>

    <div>
      Next, our journey takes us to Griffith Observatory, an iconic symbol in
      the western United States, located in Griffith Park, Los Angeles.<br />
      This observatory is one of the most famous astronomical research
      facilities in the country.<br />
      Utilizing telescopes, we begin our communication with the mysteries of the
      universe.<br />
      Especially at night, away from the city lights, encountering the smiles of
      the stars brings a serene peace to the heart.
    </div>

    <h3>Hollywood Sign Views</h3>

    <div>
      Griffith Observatory offers a perfect vantage point for capturing photos
      with the iconic Hollywood sign.<br />
      The lush forest and the sunset's reddish hues become even more enchanting
      here.
    </div>

    <h3>Captivating Night Sky</h3>

    <div>
      If you haven't seen the stars from the observatory, the city lights below
      create a mesmerizing backdrop.<br />
      The night skyline of LA, seen from Griffith Observatory, is truly
      breathtaking.
    </div><hr>

    <h2>3. Into the Deep Cosmos of the Grand Canyon</h2>

    <div>
      Lastly, our journey leads us to the Grand Canyon.<br />
      Marvel at its breathtaking views during the day and gaze at the drifting
      stars alongside the blue pine trees at night.<br />
      The Grand Canyon, even within its deep gorge, provides a clear sky, making
      it an ideal place for stargazing.
    </div>

    <h3>Horseshoe Bend: Imprint of a Horseshoe</h3>

    <div>
      The Horseshoe Bend, shaped like a horseshoe print, features a large cliff
      in the center, surrounded by a river.<br />
      It presents a unique and picturesque landscape. Be cautious of the narrow
      paths, and keep in mind the risk of falling due to the high terrain.
    </div>

    <h3>Antelope Canyon: Nature's Mystery</h3>

    <div>
      Antelope Canyon is a daytime attraction located within the Navajo Nation's
      Antelope Canyon Navajo Tribal Park.<br />
      You must reserve a guided tour with the Navajo people to explore this
      canyon.<br />
      The unique scenes, famously featured in Windows wallpapers, unfold as you
      traverse the narrow paths.
    </div>

    <h3>4 AM, the Darkest Hour</h3>

    <div>
      For the best stargazing experience at the Grand Canyon, the darkest hour
      is around 4 AM.<br />
      While Joshua Tree focuses on observing stars during the day, at the Grand
      Canyon, it's more common to enjoy the stars first and savor the daylight
      later.
